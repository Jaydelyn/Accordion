        I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends.

        Let your heart be your guide. See there how easy that is. And right there you got an almighty cloud. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.

        Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Every day I learn.
        Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Isn't that fantastic? Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents.

        Think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.

        Let's build some happy little clouds up here. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Let all these things just sort of happen. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Let's build an almighty mountain.
